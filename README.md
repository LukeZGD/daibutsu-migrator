# EverUntether Migrator

- Migrate to EverUntether from other 32-bit iOS 8 jailbreaks
- Main script is in `com.lukezgd.everuntether-migrator/DEBIAN/postinst`
- It is recommended to just use [EverPwnage](https://github.com/LukeZGD/EverPwnage) instead

"EverUntether Migrator" installs the latest [EverUntether](https://github.com/LukeZGD/daibutsu) to iOS 8 devices that are already jailbroken with EtasonJB, [Home Depot](https://github.com/LukeZGD/ohd), or openpwnage.

This is not compatible with A5(X) devices on iOS 8.0-8.2, use "EverUntether Package" instead.

1. Add my repo: https://lukezgd.github.io/repo
1. Install "EverUntether Migrator"
